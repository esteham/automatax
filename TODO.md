# TODO: Fix Taxpayer Profile Page Field Mismatch

## Steps to Complete

- [x] Update Profile.vue component to use separate first_name and last_name fields instead of full_name
  - [x] Modify form initialization to bind to first_name and last_name from props.profile
  - [x] Update template inputs to have separate fields for first_name and last_name
  - [x] Ensure form submission sends first_name and last_name correctly

- [x] Test the profile page to ensure it loads without redirects and form submits successfully (skipped per user request)
